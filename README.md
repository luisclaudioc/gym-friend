# GYMBO

GymBo is a gym-friend app that allows you to keep track of your workout and evolution in a simple way.

## Description

After many years using iPhone's notes to write down my workout plan (exercise names, sets, repetitions, weights), I finally decided to create my own application to do it. With GymBo, we can add exercises to our workout plan, and quickly edit sets, repetitions or weights, in case of changes or progress, and follow it on our next workout session.

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript to handle Frontend
- Node.js and Express to handle the server
- MongoDB and Mongoose to handle the database
- Passport and Bcrypt to handle authentication
- Axios to handle Api requests

## Future Challenges

- Make profile info editable
- Include profile picture upon registration
- Keep track of past workouts
- Improve and modernize interface
